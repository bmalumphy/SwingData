    /*Helper function for incrementing over the arrays of a player's SwingData.
     *
     *The algroithm is exactly the same as before, and runs in O(n) time with O(n) space
     *
     *However, in order to avoid decreasing readability of the code, it needs to be implemented in two
     *ways using polymorphism. The first case uses one data array, while the second utilizes two. This is
     *necessary because if it were somehow wrapped into one function, there would have to be some very messy
     *cleanup for each case. If wrapped into a [[Double]] of length 2, we would have to check if one of the
     *data arrays is empty. Or if wrapped into two inputs data1 and data2 by default, data2 would have to be
     *empty for the single array case.
     *
     *Being that this function always takes in thresholdLo and thresholdHi arguments, the functions that
     *require only one argument for threshold may choose to input a velocity or acceleration for the upper
     *bound that would be unreasonable for a player to achieve.
